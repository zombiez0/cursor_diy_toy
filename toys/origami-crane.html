                <div class="cultural-info">
                    <p>In Japanese culture, the crane is a symbol of peace, hope, and healing. Legend says that anyone who folds 1,000 paper cranes will be granted a wish! This beautiful tradition has spread around the world as a symbol of peace and remembrance.</p>
                    <p>Origami, which means "folding paper" in Japanese, has been practiced for over 1,000 years. It teaches us that with patience and precision, we can create something beautiful from the simplest materials.</p>

                        <p>Start with a perfect square of origami paper, colored side facing down. Make sure your hands are clean and your workspace is flat. Take a deep breath - origami requires calm focus!</p>
                        <div class="step-tip">
                            <strong>Perfect Start:</strong> If you don't have origami paper, you can make a square from regular paper by folding a corner to the opposite edge and cutting off the rectangle.

                        <p>Fold the paper diagonally in half, corner to corner, creating a triangle. Press down firmly to make a sharp crease. Unfold and repeat with the other diagonal. You now have an "X" crease pattern.</p>
                        <div class="step-tip">
                            <strong>Crease Tip:</strong> Use your fingernail or a bone folder to make really sharp creases. Good creases are the secret to perfect origami!

                        <p>Fold the paper in half horizontally, then unfold. Fold it in half vertically, then unfold. Your paper should now have both diagonal and straight fold lines creating a star pattern.</p>
                        <div class="step-tip">
                            <strong>Foundation:</strong> These eight crease lines will guide all your future folds. They're like a roadmap for your crane!

                        <p>Here's where the magic happens! Hold the paper with the colored side up. Push the horizontal and vertical creases in toward the center while bringing the diagonal creases up. The paper will collapse into a smaller square.</p>
                        <div class="step-tip">
                            <strong>Don't Worry:</strong> This step feels tricky at first! The paper wants to fold this way because of your creases. Be patient and let it happen naturally.

                        <p>Position the preliminary base with the open flaps facing down. Take the top layer's left and right edges and fold them to the center line, creating a kite shape. Flip over and repeat on the other side.</p>
                        <div class="step-tip">
                            <strong>Symmetry:</strong> Make sure both sides look exactly the same. Symmetry is key to a beautiful crane that will balance properly!

                        <p>Fold the top triangle down over the kite shape, then unfold everything you just did (steps 5-6). Now perform a "petal fold": lift the bottom point of the top layer up, and the sides will naturally fold inward along existing creases.</p>
                        <div class="step-tip">
                            <strong>Petal Magic:</strong> This creates a long diamond shape that looks like a flower petal - that's why it's called a petal fold!

                        <p>Flip the model over and repeat the petal fold on the other side. You now have the classic "bird base" - the foundation for many origami birds! It should look like a long diamond with four points.</p>

                        <h3>Create the Neck and Tail</h3>
                        <p>Orient the bird base so the split points are at the bottom. Take the left and right points (which will become the neck and tail) and fold them along the center line, making them thinner. These are called "inside reverse folds."</p>
                        <div class="step-tip">
                            <strong>Inside Reverse:</strong> Push the point inside the model along existing creases. It takes practice, but creates clean, elegant shapes.

                        <h3>Shape the Head</h3>
                        <p>Choose one of the long points to be the head (usually the slightly shorter one). About 1/2 inch from the tip, make another inside reverse fold to create the crane's beak. This gives your crane personality!</p>
                        <div class="step-tip">
                            <strong>Character:</strong> The size and angle of the beak can give your crane different expressions. Experiment to find one you like!

                        <p>Gently hold the neck and tail and slowly pull them apart. This will open up the body of the crane. Be gentle - you're not trying to tear the paper, just coax it into its final shape.</p>
                        <div class="step-tip">
                            <strong>Gentle Touch:</strong> The paper has memory from all your folds. Trust the creases and let the crane's body naturally expand.

                        <p>Gently press down on the body while pulling the wings out to the sides. The wings should be level and symmetrical. You can gently curve them downward for a more realistic look.</p>

                            <strong>Final Touch:</strong> Real cranes have slightly curved wings. A gentle curve makes your paper crane look more lifelike and elegant.
